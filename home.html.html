    <h1>Exploring Italy & Greece</h1>
    <h2>With Your Semi-qualified Tour Guide <i> Avry Griffin </i> </h2>
    <p>Join me in reliving my trip to Europe in June and July of 2017.</p>
    <p>From Roma to Athenas, you will be able to view the amazing sights I saw without having to spend a semester's worth of tuition!</p>
    <p>You'll even get to meet some of my best friends, my favorite teachers, and even my mom!</p>
